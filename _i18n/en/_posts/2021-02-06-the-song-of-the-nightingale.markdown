In the [MOMkult](https://momkult.hu/) online series you can get to know Hungarian birds through different artistic mediums. 🐦 They invited me to join in. So, I went to the forest with some instruments and paid a tribute to the nightingale's enchanting songs. 🌳 I sat down and listened. Ideas rushed in and I drafted some sounds. 🌳 Here is for you the result to enjoy in this little music video.
