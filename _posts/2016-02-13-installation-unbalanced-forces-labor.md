SOUND INSTALLATION//

//JÉRÔME LI-THIAO-TÉ /original concept/

Aren’t we making the transition from former to new times, the scapegoat for our lack of intervention and responsible actions? Through their installation, the artists offer a reflection on a contemporary “photography” of the present Hungarian society.

The space itself echoes the reminiscences of its visits.

As visitors, let’s consider our options:
//Raise our voice or remain silent?
//Can we change the way we live together?
//Are we the ones deciding our destiny?

VIDEO INSTALLATION//

//ANNA RUBI

Indefinitely, iconic spaces, statues covered with dust or even with snow are discreetly clinging into the present, still possessing our own territory. Images of inertia are colliding with the sounds of here and now.

This condition can only be changed by its visitors. From the drift of inequality there is a way out through recognising our responsibility and being consciously present.
