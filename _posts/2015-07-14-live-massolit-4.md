Jérôme Li-Thiao-Té & Endre Kertész take the floor.

Cello player. Cellist. Cello is the diminutive suffix of the word violoncello. Violone means double bass, what belongs to the family of the Viola de gambas; the cello though, is descendant of the Violin family.
Endre Kertész is a musician. A classical one.
His partner in crime is an Austrian instrument from 1828. They can be seen at concert halls, theatres, clubs and on the streets or on the internet as well. They’re silent most of the time, but sometimes they make sounds – both of them in their own way.
“Sometimes it works. Other times it doesn’t.”

*J3ZZ – Massolit Series offers a space where the audience can experience the instant creativity of sound artists. Artists meet with no preparation and improvise, interact on the spot for ~30 minutes. Then the audience is invited to ask any questions or share with the artists. Conversations’ topics are open as improvisation is free.*
