Jérôme Li-Thiao-Té & composer Ernő Zoltán Rubik take the floor.

Ernő Zoltán Rubik is a pianist, improviser and composer. In his music he explores the division between audience and performer, improvisation and composition, live and recorded material. He works in theater and dance projects (Krétakör, The Symptoms, Research Into the Unknown grant) which challenge him both as a musician and as a physical performer. He has performed as a dancer (Collective Comipoq) and is also a versatile beat boxer and vocalist. He plays improvised music and free jazz with his groups rubik.erno.quintet and trio:beeper. Since 2011 he curates the weekly improvised music series called JAZZAJ. He has studied composition at Liszt Ferenc Music Academy, Budapest.

*J3ZZ – Massolit Series offers a space where the audience can experience the instant creativity of sound artists. Artists meet with no preparation and improvise, interact on the spot for ~30 minutes. Then the audience is invited to ask any questions or share with the artists. Conversations’ topics are open as improvisation is free.*
