Groups: duo with Jean-Hervé Péron Art-Errorist (from the legendary krautrock band Faust), Ahad & ChrS (with Christian Skjødt), collaborations with Franz Hautzinger, Julo Fujak and Isabelle Duthoit, I Belong to the Band (with Adam Bohman, Oli Mayne and Jean-Michel Van Schouwburg), trio with Richard Barrett and Milana Zarić, duo with Christian Kobi etc. His field of interest and activity – beside music – includes the borderline and the margin of different art forms, too. Sőrés is also collaborate with artists from different fields of art (choreographers, stage directors, fine artists, videomakers, phonic poets). In 2012 he was the Hungarian curator of the international ”Sound Exchange – Experimental Music Cultures in Central and Eastern Europe” project. In 2014 Sőrés curated the first collective international sound installation exhibition in Hungary called ”On the Edge of Perceptibility – Sound Art” at Kunsthalle, Budapest. In 2008 he edited a book and wrote a preface study about ”New Chances of Autonomy” with the texts by Hakim Bey aka Peter Lamborn Wilson among other onthological anarchists. He is currently working with Inconsolable Ghost on the soundtrack to the new version of Andrey Iskanov’s hallucinogenic horror classic ”Visions of Suffering”.

*J3ZZ – Massolit Series offers a space where the audience can experience the instant creativity of sound artists. Artists meet with no preparation and improvise, interact on the spot for ~30 minutes. Then the audience is invited to ask any questions or share with the artists. Conversations’ topics are open as improvisation is free.*
