                <h2>HYBRIS</h2>
                <h3>an acoustic strings improvisative side project</h3>
                <p>Through HYBRIS, I attempt to pay tribute to what made the core of my music inspiration: classical music. From a very young age, I was influenced by classical music.
                  It feels natural and reassuring for me to play the violin and it came to my mind that I wanted the so-called classical music to be as alive as possible,
                  which meant to me that I wanted to create music with strings in presence of an audience. Slowly, I shared with classical musicans and the journey began.
                  My first partner in crime is Endre Kert√©sz, fantastic cellist from Hungary.
                </p>
