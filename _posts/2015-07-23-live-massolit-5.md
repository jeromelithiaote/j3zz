[Bálint Bolcsó](http://bolcso.net/en/news) (*1979) studied instrumental and electroacoustic composition in Budapest and Vienna. He was a regular participant of the International Bartók Seminar in Szombathely, Hungary. His compositions were performed at Bartók Festival, Budapest Autumn Festival, Making New Waves, Wien Modern, mise-en music festival (New York) and CAFe Budapest, among others. He writes vocal, instrumental and electroacoustic pieces, radio plays, sound installations as well as applied music for film, dance and theatre. He is involved with electroacoustic music and live electronics as composer, improviser and university lecturer. Recent improvised music settings include rubik.erno.quintet, trio:beeper and duos with Christian Kobi, Jonas Kocher, Zsolt Sőrés, Gergely Kovács and Gergő Kováts.

*J3ZZ – Massolit Series offers a space where the audience can experience the instant creativity of sound artists. Artists meet with no preparation and improvise, interact on the spot for ~30 minutes. Then the audience is invited to ask any questions or share with the artists. Conversations’ topics are open as improvisation is free.*
