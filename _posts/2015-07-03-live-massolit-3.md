Jérôme Li-Thiao-Té & Áron Porteleki take the floor.

Áron Porteleki grew up in the hungarian „Táncház” (dance-house) movement in Budapest. As a child he learned the three-stringed viola from Transylvanian and Hungarian musicians and took jazz lessons on drums. In the past 8-10 years he took part in several music groups, from improvised jazz to pop-rock and became a professional recording and performing artist mostly on his drums, but being part of the folk music era as well. Now his main interests focused on connecting the different types of improvisations found in folk music and jazz, and to transform the experiences on his viola into new rhythmic structures on drums.

*J3ZZ – Massolit Series offers a space where the audience can experience the instant creativity of sound artists. Artists meet with no preparation and improvise, interact on the spot for ~30 minutes. Then the audience is invited to ask any questions or share with the artists. Conversations’ topics are open as improvisation is free.*
