This is the first time, the two musicians, Jérôme Li-Thiao-Té & Áron Porteleki, perform on the same stage. They present their new collaboration in a very intimate venue where the audience is at arm reach.

*“I am trying to understand/combine several ways of expressions. I have been experimenting diverse ways of improvising as a musician with artists from media and dance, etc. As an audio artist, this project allows me to transcribe via the technology, a symbol of organic/human sounds – the audio link between every human being.

We focus on an interpretation of the Hungarian culture & society. Travels, field recordings, interviews, encounters with Hungarian people etc. have been the starting point of this creation, using various contemporary (analog & digital) techniques.” – Jérôme Li-Thiao-Té*

* Jérôme Li-Thiao-Té - violin
* Áron Porteleki – drums, brácsa
